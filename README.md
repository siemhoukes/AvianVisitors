| 1 | Micro SD Card (≥32 GB) | ~$10 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=32gb+micro+sd+card&i=electronics&crid=1RCJAD1J0EPDX&sprefix=32gb+micro+sd+card%2Celectronics%2C226&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) | |
| 1 | USB lavalier microphone | $16.95 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0176NRE1G) | |
| 1 | Pi power supply | ~$10 | - | |

Optional: a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to restyle illustrations, an [eBird API key](https://ebird.org/api/keygen) to filter species by region.

---

## 1. Flash the SD card

Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Pick Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit). In the customisation dialog set:

- Username
- WiFi SSID + password
- Hostname: `birdnet`
- Enable SSH with password auth

Plug the USB mic into the Pi. Place the capsule in a window or mount it outside. Boot.

---

## 2. Run the installer

Installer assumes passwordless sudo (Raspberry Pi OS Lite default - if you've tightened it, run `sudo raspi-config` -> *System Options* -> restore the default first).

```bash
ssh <your-username>@birdnet.local
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siemhoukes/AvianVisitors/avian-visitors/newinstaller.sh | bash
```

Clones this fork, installs BirdNET-Pi, symlinks the AvianVisitors overlay into the Caddy web root. Takes 20-40 minutes. Reboots when done.

Collage: `http://birdnet.local/`. Stock BirdNET-Pi UI: `http://birdnet.local/index.php`. The menu button in the top right opens an admin overlay with settings, system, log, and tool panels.

---

## 3. (Optional) Restyle the illustrations

The repo ships with 498 bundled illustrations (249 species, perched + flight). To restyle them or generate a set for your own region:

```bash
pip install -r ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/requirements.txt
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-key'

# generate on a cream ground, cut the ground off, rebuild the collage masks
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/pregen.py --labels ~/BirdNET-Pi/model/labels.txt --force
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/cutout.py
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/build_masks.py
```

Filter to your region with `--ebird-region US-CA` (needs `EBIRD_API_KEY`). The full pipeline, prompt, reference images, and per-species tuning live in [`avian/scripts/README.md`](avian/scripts/README.md). Style lives in [`prompt.template.md`](avian/scripts/prompt.template.md).

---

## 4. (Optional) Forward off your LAN

See [`avian/forwarding/`](avian/forwarding/) for three independent recipes:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** for a public HTTPS URL.
- **Home Assistant REST sensor** that exposes the latest detection.
- **MQTT bridge** that publishes every new detection.

---

## Develop & deploy (this fork)

This fork ([siemhoukes/AvianVisitors](https://github.com/siemhoukes/AvianVisitors)) is the source of truth. The installer clones it to `~/BirdNET-Pi` on the Pi, so deploying a change is:

```bash
# locally: edit, commit, push
git push origin avian-visitors

# on the Pi: pull + restart
ssh <user>@birdnet.local "cd ~/BirdNET-Pi && git pull --ff-only && scripts/restart_services.sh"
```

To pick up upstream improvements: `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/avian-visitors`.
